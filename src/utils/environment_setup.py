Environment Setup Module
========================

This module provides utility functions to detect the execution environment 
(Kaggle, Colab, local) and set up necessary configurations, particularly for 
RAPIDS and PySpark with RAPIDS integration.

Key Functions:
- `determine_environment`: Detects if the code is running in Kaggle, Colab, or a local setup.
- `install_rapids`: Attempts to install RAPIDS libraries if running in Colab. 
  Provides guidance for Kaggle (pre-installed) and local setups.
- `configure_pyspark_with_rapids`: Configures an existing PySpark session to use the
  RAPIDS Accelerator for Spark.
- `setup_distributed_gpu_spark`: Adjusts Spark configuration for distributed GPU usage.
- `main` (as a setup orchestrator): A function that demonstrates the sequence of setup steps,
  including environment detection, RAPIDS installation, and Spark configuration. 
  The SparkSession creation within this `main` is a basic placeholder and might need
  to be adapted based on the project's specific Spark initialization requirements.

Note: Active use of Spark for distributed GPU processing beyond RAPIDS SQL plugin 
(e.g., for distributed model training via Spark MLlib with GPU acceleration) would 
require a more comprehensive Spark setup and potentially different library choices 
(e.g., Horovod on Spark, TensorFlowOnSpark).
