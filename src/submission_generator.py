Submission File Generator Module
================================

This module provides the `generate_submission_file` function, which is responsible
for taking a trained model and live feature data to produce a submission file
in the format required by the Numerai Signals competition.

The function handles:
- Ensuring the live features DataFrame contains the necessary columns.
- Generating predictions using the provided model.
- Aligning predictions with original live data identifiers (ticker, date).
- Formatting the submission DataFrame with 'numerai_ticker', 'friday_date', and 'signal' columns.
- Ensuring the 'friday_date' is in the correct integer format (YYYYMMDD).
- Saving the submission file to CSV.

It supports both pandas and cuDF DataFrames for input and uses logging for
tracking progress and errors.

The file `src/submission_generator.py` has been created with the `generate_submission_file` function.

**Key features implemented:**
*   Takes `model`, `live_features_df` (already pruned to selected features), `original_live_df_ids`, `feature_names`, and `submission_filepath` as input.
*   Selects features from `live_features_df` based on `feature_names` to ensure correct columns and order.
*   Generates predictions using `model.predict()`. It assumes the model's predict method is compatible with the input DataFrame type (pandas/cuDF).
*   Constructs the submission DataFrame using `numerai_ticker` and `friday_date` from `original_live_df_ids`.
    *   Includes a fallback to rename 'ticker' to 'numerai_ticker' if the latter is not found.
*   Adds predictions to the 'signal' column.
*   Ensures `friday_date` is an integer (YYYYMMDD format). If it's a datetime object, it's converted.
*   Renames the date column to `friday_date` if it was different (e.g. `target_col_name_in_ids` was different).
*   Saves the final DataFrame with columns `numerai_ticker,friday_date,signal` to a CSV file without the index.
*   Creates the output directory if it doesn't exist.
*   Includes an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block with example usage for both pandas and cuDF DataFrames (if cuDF is available).

This function provides the core logic for generating the submission file. The next step is to integrate this into `main.py` and update the configuration.

I will now proceed to update `config/config.py`.The file `src/submission_generator.py` has been created with the `generate_submission_file` function. This function handles the logic for generating predictions on live data and formatting them into the required CSV submission file format. It includes error checking, support for both pandas and cuDF DataFrames, and an example usage block.

Next, I will update `config/config.py` to include the `SUBMISSION_PARAMS`.
